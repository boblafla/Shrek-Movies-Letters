Prince Charming: Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl. And throughout the land, everyone was happy. Until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower there to await the kiss of the handsome prince charming!

Prince Charming: It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon’s keep. [crows caw] For he was the bravest, and most handsome… in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess’s chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her… [the prince gasps, seeing the Big Bad Wolf in Fiona's place]

Wolf: What?

Prince Charming: Princess…Fiona?

Wolf: No!

[The prince sighs of relief]

Prince Charming: Oh, thank heavens... where is she?

Wolf: She’s on her honeymoon.

Prince Charming: Honeymoon? With whom?!

Shrek: It’s a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. [screaming]

- Whoa!


Donkey: Hold on, Shrek! I’m coming!

Shrek: Come on! Get it off! Get it off!


Oh, God. Oh…


No!


Donkey: Look out, Shrek! Hold still! Shrek! Hold still!

Shrek: Get it off!

Donkey: Did I miss?

Shrek: No. You got them.

Puss: Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from… Puss… in Boots!

Shrek: I’ll kill that cat!

Puss: Ah-ha-ha! [coughs] [wheezes] [retches] [coughs] [chuckles] Hairball.

Donkey: Oh! That is nasty!


What should we do with him?


Take the sword and neuter him.

Give him the Bob Barker treatment.


Oh, no! Por favor!

Please!


I implore you!

It was nothing personal, Señor.


I was doing it only for my family.


My mother, she is sick.

And my father lives off the garbage!


The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers…


Whoa, whoa, whoa!


Fiona’s father paid you to do this?


The rich King? Sí.


[screams]


Well, so much for Dad’s royal blessing.


Don’t feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.


Gee, thanks.


Maybe Fiona would’ve been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.


That’s what the King said.


Oh, uh… sorry. I thought that question was directed at me.


Shrek, Fiona knows you’d do anything for her.


Well, it’s not like

I wouldn’t change if I could.


I just… I just wish I could make her happy.


Hold the phone…


"Happiness."


"A tear drop away."


Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that’s ever happened to you!


Aw, man, where do I begin?


First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.


Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me.


Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Piñata!!"


What is a piñata, anyway?


No, Donkey! I need you to cry!


Don’t go projecting on me.


I know you’re feeling bad, but you got to…


Aaaahhh!


You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of…


Fairy Godmother: What? Is it on? Is it on? [clears throat] This is Fairy Godmother.



I’m either away from my desk or with a client.


But if you come by the office, we’ll be glad to make you an appointment.


Have a "happy ever after."


Oh…


Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?


That’s more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure!


Ain’t no stoppin’ us now! Whoo! We’re on the move!


- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.

- Join the club. We’ve got jackets.


On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.


The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.


Let’s go, Shrek. Shrek?


- Shrek!

- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him…in his wee little boots.


You know, how many cats can wear boots?

Honestly.


- Let’s keep him!

- Say what?


[purrs]


Ahh!


Listen. He’s purring!


- Oh, so now it’s cute.

[trying to convince Donkey to let Puss in Boots join them] Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.


Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who’s telling who to lighten up!


Lighten up? I should lighten up?

Look who’s telling who to lighten up!


Fiona: [giggles] Shrek!


[barks]


[barks]


Shrek?


Lillian: They’re both festive, aren’t they? What do you think, Harold?


Um… Yes, yes.

Fine. Fine.


[sighs]


Try to at least pretend you’re interested in your daughter’s wedding ball.


Honestly, Lillian, I don’t think it matters.


How do we know there will even be a ball?


Mom. Dad.


- Oh, hello, dear.

- What’s that, Cedric? Right! Coming.


Mom, have you seen Shrek?


I haven’t. You should ask your father.


Be sure and use small words, dear.

He’s a little slow this morning.


- Can I help you, Your Majesty?

- Ah, yes! Um…


Mmm! Exquisite.

What do you call this dish?


That would be the dog’s breakfast,

Your Majesty.


Ah, yes. Very good, then.

Carry on, Cedric.


- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?

- No, I haven’t, dear.


I’m sure he just went off to look for a nice… mud hole to cool down in.


You know, after your little spat last night.


Oh. You heard that, huh?


The whole kingdom heard you.


I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be… well, a bit of a brute.


Him? You know, you didn’t exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.


Well, what did you expect?

Look at what he’s done to you.


Shrek loves me for who I am.


I would think you’d be happy for me.


Darling, I’m just thinking about

what’s best for you.


Maybe you should do the same.


[both whisper]


No, really?


[both laugh]


[Shrek] Shh…


Oh…


[hooter blasts]


Donkey: Oh, no. That’s the old Keebler’s place. Let’s back away slowly.

Puss in Boots: That’s the Fairy Godmother’s cottage. She’s the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.

Shrek: Then why don’t we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!

[Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter]

Puss in Boots: He makes me laugh.

Shrek: Hi. I’m here to see the…

Jerome: The Fairy Godmother. I’m sorry. She is not in.

Fairy Godmother: Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!

Jerome: [sighs] Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she’s not seeing any clients today, OK?

Shrek: That’s OK, buddy. We’re from the union.

Jerome: The union?

Shrek: We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.

Jerome: Oh! Oh, right.

Shrek: Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?

Jerome: Uh… a little. We don’t even have dental.

Shrek: They don’t even have dental. Okay, we’ll just have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it’d be better if the Fairy Godmother didn’t know we were here. Know what I’m saying? Huh?

Donkey: Huh? Huh? Huh?

Shrek: Stop it.

Jerome: Of course. Go right in.

Fairy Godmother: A drop of desire. [giggles] Naughty! A pinch of passion. [laughs] And just a hint of… lust! [laughs]

Shrek: Excuse me.

Fairy Godmother: [gasps]

Shrek: Sorry to barge in like this…

Fairy Godmother: What in Grimm’s name are you doing here?

Shrek: Well, it seems that Fiona’s not exactly happy.

Fairy Godmother: Oh-ho-ho! And there’s some question as to why that is? Well, let’s explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P… Princess. Cinderella. Here we are. Lived happily ever after." Oh… [laughs] No ogres! Let’s see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman…No, no, no, no, no! You see, ogres don’t live happily ever after.

Shrek: All right, look, lady!

Fairy Godmother: Don’t you point… those dirty green sausages at me!

Worker Elf: Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry.

Shrek: Ah… that’s okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother.

Fairy Godmother: Just… go.

Shrek: Come on, guys. TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?

Donkey: Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks!

Puss in Boots: You don’t exactly smell like a basket of roses.

Shrek: Well, one of these has got to help.

Puss in Boots: I was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one.

Donkey: Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we’ll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea.

Shrek: Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?

Puss in Boots: No problema, boss. In one of my nine lives, I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.

Donkey: Shrek, are you off your nut?

Shrek: Donkey, keep watch.

Donkey: Keep watch? Yeah, I’ll keep watch. I’ll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. I’ll laugh, too. I’ll be giggling to myself.

Shrek: What do you see?

Puss in Boots: Toad Stool Softener?

Donkey: I’m sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.

Puss: Elfa Seltzer?

Shrek: Uh-uh.

Puss: Hex Lax?

Shrek: No! Try "handsome." Sorry. No handsome.

Puss in Boots: Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?

Shrek: Well, what does it do?

Puss in Boots: It says "Beauty Divine."

Donkey: In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of all creatures. Especially us talking ones.

Shrek: [gasps] Donkey! That’ll have to do. We’ve got company.

Donkey: Can we get on with this?

Shrek: Hurry! Nice catch, Donkey!

Puss: [after Donkey catches the "Happily Ever After" potion in his mouth] Finally! A good use for your mouth.


[♪ Pete Yorn: Ever Fallen In Love]

Shrek: Come on!

You spurn my natural emotions


You make me feel like dirt and I’m hurt


And if I start a commotion


I run the risk of losing you and that’s worse

I don’t care whose fault it is.

Just get this place cleaned up!


And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!


- Mother!

- Charming. Sweetheart.


This isn’t a good time, pumpkin.

Mama’s working.


Whoa, what happened here?


Fairy Godmother: The ogre, that’s what!

Prince Charming: What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!

Fairy Godmother: Oh, put it away, Junior! You’re still going to be king. We’ll just have to come up with something smarter.



Pardon. Um… Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.

Fairy Godmother: What? Oh… I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.

Shrek: "Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. "For you and your true love. "If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. "Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."

Donkey: You both will be fine?

Shrek: I guess it means it’ll affect Fiona, too.

Donkey: Hey, man, this don’t feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. You just want you to drop that jug o’ voodoo and let’s get out of here.

Shrek: It says, "Beauty Divine." How bad can it be? [sneezes]

Donkey: See, you’re allergic to that stuff. You’ll have a reaction. And if you think that I’ll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!

Puss in Boots: Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion… allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.

Donkey: Oh, no, no. I don’t think so. If there’ll be any animal testing, I’ll do it. That’s the best friend’s job. Now give me that bottle.

Shrek: How do you feel?

Donkey: I don’t feel any different. I look any different?

Puss in Boots: You still look like an ass to me.

Shrek: Maybe it doesn’t work on donkeys. Well, here’s to us, Fiona.

Donkey: Shrek? You drink that, there’s no going back.

Shrek: I know.

Donkey: No more wallowing in the mud?

Shrek: I know.

Donkey: No more itchy butt crack?

Shrek: I know!

Donkey: But you love being an ogre!

Shrek: I know! But I love Fiona more.

Donkey: Shrek, no! Wait!


[gurgling]


[farts]


Got to be… I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.


Maybe it’s a dud.


Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be.


[thunder rumbles]


Donkey: Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I feel something coming on. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die! Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I’m melting! I’m melting!

Shrek: It’s just the rain, Donkey.

Donkey: [chuckles] Oh. Don’t worry. Things seem bad because it’s dark and rainyand Fiona’s father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.

[hisses]

Donkey: lt’ll be better in the morning. You’ll see… The sun’ll come out… Tomorrow [yawns] Bet your bottom…

Shrek: Bet my bottom?

Donkey: I’m coming, Elizabeth!

Shrek: Donkey? Are you all right?

Puss in Boots: Hey, boss. Let’s shave him.

Shrek: D-Donkey? [groans]


[Puss In Boots shrieks]


There you are!

We missed you at dinner.


What is it, darling?


Dad…


I’ve been thinking about what you said.


And I’m going to set things right.


Ah! Excellent!

That’s my girl.


Fiona: It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I’m going to go out and find him. And then we’ll go back to the swamp where we belong.

Lillian: Fiona, please!

Harold: Let’s not be rash, darling. You can’t go anywhere right now.


[rain patters]


Both: Fiona!


Look, I told you he was here.

Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.


[Shrek groans]


Good morning, sleepyhead.


[Shrek shouts]


[All] Good morning!


We love your kitty!

- Here, I fetched a pail of water.


Shrek: Thanks. Uhh! Aahh! Oh… [examines his new, human body] A cute, button nose? Thick, wavy locks? Taut, round buttocks?! I’m… I’m…

- Gorgeous!

- I’ll say.


I’m Jill. What’s your name?


- Um… Shrek.

- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?


- You’re tense.

- I want to rub his shoulders.


- I got it covered.

- I don’t have anything to rub.


Get in line.


Get in line.


- Have you seen my donkey?

Donkey: Who are you calling donkey?

Shrek: Donkey? You’re a…

Donkey: A stallion, baby! I can whinny. [whinnies] I can count. Look at me, Shrek! I’m trotting!



That’s some quality potion.

What’s in that stuff?


"Oh, don’t take the potion,

Mr. Boss, it’s very bad."


Pah!


"Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping.


"Not intended for heart patients or those with… nervous disorders."


I’m trotting, I’m trotting in place! Yeah!


What?


Puss in Boots: Señor? "To make the effects of this potion permanent, the drinker must obtain his true love’s kiss by midnight."

Shrek: Midnight? Why is it always midnight?


- Pick me! I’ll be your true love!

- I’ll be your true love.


I’ll be true… enough.


Look, ladies, I already have a true love.


[all] Oh…


And take it from me, Boss.


You are going to have one satisfied Princess.


And let’s face it.

You are a lot easier on the eyes.


Inside you’re the same old mean, salty…


- Easy.

…cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.



And you’re still the same annoying donkey.


- Yeah.

- [sighs]


Well…


Look out, Princess.

Here comes the new me.


First things first.

- Ready?

- Ready!

- Driver, stop!


Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I’m blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again?


You poor creature!


Is there anything

I can do for you?


Well, I guess there is one thing.


Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers.

Donkey: Not bad at all.

King Harold: Well, I’m afraid Fiona isn’t really… warming up to Prince Charming.

Prince Charming: FYI, not my fault.

Fairy Godmother: No, of course it’s not, dear.

Prince Charming: I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I’m that dreadful ogre?

King Harold: No, no, it’s nobody’s fault. Perhaps it’s best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?

Both: What?

King Harold: I mean, You can’t force someone to fall in love!

Fairy Godmother: I beg to differ. I do it all the time! Have Fiona drink this and she’ll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.

King Harold: Umm… no.

Fairy Godmother: What did you say?

King Harold: I can’t. I won’t do it.

Fairy Godmother: Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily. Is that what you want? Is it?

King Harold: No.

Fairy Godmother: Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming’s hair before the ball. He’s hopeless. He’s all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back of your hair.

Pinocchio: I’m not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.

Gingerbread Man: Whizzes on you guys. Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left!

Announcer: Tonight on "Knights"…

Gingerbread Man: Now here’s a good show!


We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup.


It’s time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won’t fly.


Why you grabbing me?

Donkey: Police brutality!

Shrek: I have to talk to Princess Fiona!


- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!


Man on voice over: Wanna get away with it? Or did someone let the cat out of the bag?

Puss in Boots: You capitalist pig dogs!

[shrieks]


- Catnip!

Puss in Boots: That’s, uh, not mine.


Find Princess Fiona!


Donkey: I’m a donkey!

Shrek: Tell her Shrek… I’m her husband, Shrek!

Gingerbread Man: Quick! Rewind it!

[The part rewinds and then plays]

Shrek: I’m her husband, Shrek! Ow!


[knock on door]


Darling?


Ah. I thought I might find you here.


How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?


I’m not going.


The whole Kingdom’s turned out to celebrate your marriage.


There’s just one problem.

That’s not my husband.


I mean, look at him.


Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love.


You’d be surprised how much

I changed for your mother.


Change?


He’s completely lost his mind!


Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance?


You might find you like this new Shrek.


But it’s the old one

I fell in love with, Dad.


I’d give anything to have him back.


King Harold: Darling. That’s mine. Decaf.


Otherwise I’m up all night.


Thanks.

Donkey: I gotta get out of here! You can’t lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You’re supposed to say, I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!

Shrek: You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity.

Puss in Boots: I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.

Pinocchio: Shrek? Donkey?

Puss in Boots: Too late.

Shrek: Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here!


[♪ Theme from Mission Impossible]


Pig 1: Fire in ze hole!


[explosion]


Gingy: Look out below!

Shrek: Quick! Tell a lie!


- What should I say?

- Anything, but quick!


Donkey: Say something crazy like "I’m wearing ladies’ underwear!"

Pinocchio: I am wearing ladies’ underwear.

Shrek: Are you?

Pinocchio: I most certainly am not!

Donkey: It looks like you most certainly am are!

Pinocchio: I am not!

Puss In Boots: What kind?

Gingy: It’s a thong!
Pinocchio: Oww! They’re briefs!
Gingy: Are not!

Pinocchio: Are too!

Gingy: Are not!

Pinocchio: Are too!

Gingy: Here we go. Hang tight.


[Donkey] Wait, wait, wait!

Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!


Ow!


- Excuse me?

- What? Puss!


Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?


- Sorry, boss.

- Quit messing around!


We’ve got to stop that kiss!


I thought you was going to let her go.



I was, but I can’t let them do this to Fiona.


Donkey: Boom! That’s what I like to hear. Look who’s coming around!

Puss in Boots: It’s impossible! We’ll never get in. The castle’s guarded and there’s a moat and everything.


Gingy: Well, folks, it looks like we’re up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.


- What?

Shrek: Do you still know the Muffin Man?

Gingy: Well, sure! He’s down on Drury Lane. Why?

Shrek: Because we’re gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour.

Muffin Man: Gingy!

Gingy: Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We’ve got a big order to fill!


[evil chuckling]


Gingy: It’s alive!


[rumbling]


[gasping]


Donkey: [whinnies] Run, run, run, as fast you can!


[screaming]


Gingy: Go, baby, go!


There it is, Mongo!

To the castle!


[Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry!

Come on!


[people screaming]


[Donkey] Mongo! Down here!

Look at the pony!


That’s right! Follow the pretty pony!


Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!


[Mongo] Pretty pony.


Ladies and gentlemen,


Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek!


[applause]


Shrek, what are you doing?


I’m just playing the part, Fiona.


Is that glitter on your lips?


Prince Charming: Mm. Cherry flavored.

Want to taste?


- Ugh! What is with you?

- But, Muffin Cake…


C Minor, put it in C Minor.


Ladies and gentlemen!


[applause, cheering]


I’d like to dedicate this song to…


Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek!


Fiona, my Princess.


Will you honor me with a dance?


Where have all the good men gone


And where are all the gods?


[all chanting] Dance!


Where’s the streetwise Hercules


To fight the rising odds?


Since when do you dance?


Fiona, my dearest,

if there’s one thing I know,


it’s that love is full of surprises.


Late at night I toss and I turn


And I dream of what I need


Hit it!


I need a hero


Shrek: All right, big fella! Let’s crash this party!


Man the catapults!


Aim! Fire!


Shrek: Brace yourselves!

Mongo: Ooh! Purty!


[groaning]


Not the gumdrop button!


[enraged howling]


Incoming!


Ha-ha! All right!


Somewhere after midnight In my wildest fantasy


Shrek: Go, Mongo! Go!


Man the cauldrons!


After you, Mongo.


- That’s it! Heave-ho!

- Watch out!


Donkey: Shrek!


Knight: More heat, less foam!


Up where the mountains Meet the heavens above


Out where the lightning Splits the sea


I could swear there is someone Somewhere watching me


Heave! Ho!


[Gingy, slow-motion] No!


[Mongo groans]


Shrek: [whistles] Come on!


[cheering]


Look out!


- Be good.

- [weeping]


[sobbing] He needs me!

Let me go!


Donkey!


Puss!


Puss in Boots: Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go! Today, I repay my debt.


[all] Aww…


Puss in Boots: [growling] On guard!


He’s gotta be strong And he’s gotta be fast


And he’s gotta be fresh From the fight


- I need a hero

Shrek: Stop!

[Donkey whinnies]

Shrek: Hey, you! Back away from my wife.

Fiona: Shrek?

Fairy Godmother: You couldn’t just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.

Shrek: Now!

Three Little Pigs: Pigs und blanket!

Shrek: Pinocchio! Get the wand!

Pig #2: I see London! I see France!

Pinocchio: Waaaahhh! I’m a real boy!

Pig #1: Catch!

Gingerbread Man: Donkey!

Pinocchio: I’m a real boy.

Fairy Godmother: That’s mine! That’s mine!

Donkey: Pray for mercy, from Puss…

Puss: And Donkey!

Fairy Godmother: She’s taken the potion! Kiss her now!

Shrek: No!


- Hi-ya!

- [crowd gasp]

Shrek: Fiona.

Fiona: Shrek.

Fairy Godmother: Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion!

King Harold: Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.


- [Charming] Mommy!

Fiona: Mommy?

Fairy Godmother: [about to zap Shrek with her wand] [growls] I told you. Ogres don’t live happily ever after!


[screams]


Woo!


Ha!


[breathes deeply]


Fiona: [gasping] Oh, Dad!


[sobbing]


Pinocchio: Is he…?

Gingy: Yup.


[croaking]


Gingy: He croaked.

Queen Lilian: Harold?

Fiona: Dad?

King Harold: I’d hoped you’d never see me like this.


Donkey: And he gave you a hard time!

- Donkey!


King Harold: No, no, he’s right. I’m sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now… she already has it. Shrek, Fiona… Will you accept an old frog’s apologies… and my blessing?

Queen Lilian: Harold?

King Harold: I’m sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve.

Queen Lilian: You’re more that man today than you ever were… warts and all.


King Harold: [ribbits]


[clock chimes]


Puss: Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!
Shrek: Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever?
Fiona: What?
Shrek: Because if you kiss me now…we can stay like this.


You’d do that?


- For me?

- Yes.


I want what any princess wants.


To live happily ever after…


with the ogre I married.


Puss in Boots: Whatever happens, I must not cry! You cannot make me cry!


[sobbing]


[clock chimes]


Whoa!


No. No, no.

Aaah! Ow.


Oh, no.


[sighs]


Shrek: [laughs] Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.


[giggles] Now, where were we?

Shrek: Oh. I remember.
